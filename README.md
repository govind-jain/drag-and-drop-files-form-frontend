# drag-and-drop-files-form-frontend

## Tech Stack: -
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery

## Things imported via links: -
- Google fonts
- Bootstrap libraries
- Javascript & jQuery libraries

## Elements of frontend: -
- A dropbox where you can drag-and-drop files
- A button to manually select files.
- A submit button

## Function: -
- Submit button will submit the selected files.
- When you drag-and-drop files, the color of the box and the border will change while your files are over the box.

## Limitations: -
- After selecting files, you cannot see the preview of files selected (like the preview of images).
- Suppose you selected the files once, if you again select files by any means, the previously selected files will not be submitted, i.e you need to take things in one shot.
